# Code Samples
Curated selection of code I've written.

## Python
* [Merged PR to scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/5237): Changed default behavior of ROC curve computation to work better with large datasets by dropping unnecessary thresholds, and implemented new tests for the new behavior.
* [Solution to Project Euler 517](https://github.com/gclenaghan/codesamples/blob/master/517.py): Uses dynamic programming and a few arithmetic algorithms to solve [this problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=517).

## C++
* [Churchill Navigation Challenge](https://github.com/gclenaghan/churchill): Implements building and then searching a kd-tree for the top `k` points within a given rectangle as part of a programming challenge. Details of implementation in link.

## Javascript/D3
* [Statistical Interactive Explorer of Vaccine Efficacy](https://github.com/nkullman/SIEVE): Final project for data visualization CS class, visualizations to aid in statistical analysis of vaccine studies, with a publication in preparation. Current product [here](http://nkullman.github.io/SIEVE/). I implemented selection in overview, stacked bar charts, box charts, among others.
* [Fremont Bicycle Count Visualization](https://github.com/gclenaghan/bikedata): Assignment for same class, final product [here](http://cse512-15s.github.io/a3-nkullman-gclenagh/). I implemented the selection controls and data manipulation parts (which refilter and reaggregate upon changing selection).
